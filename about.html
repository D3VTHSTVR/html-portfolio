<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Victor Rodriguez — a U.S. Marine Corps veteran turned 
  Computer Science professional with a passion for building thoughtful, 
  user-centered technology. I bring a unique blend of leadership, 
  technical expertise, and real-world problem-solving to every project 
  I take on.
</p>

<p>
  After earning my degree in Computer Science, I’ve focused on developing 
  full-stack applications, system integration, and data-driven tools that 
  deliver real impact. Whether I’m debugging embedded systems, designing 
  intuitive web interfaces, or exploring AI and cybersecurity, I thrive 
  at the intersection of innovation and reliability.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I’m expanding my knowledge in cybersecurity while also working 
  on a travel and personal finance app that helps students plan and manage 
  study-abroad trips. My approach is rooted in clear communication, iterative 
  design, and a strong commitment to lifelong learning.
</p>

<p>
  When I’m not coding, you’ll find me traveling, learning languages, or 
  mentoring others through their own technical journeys.
